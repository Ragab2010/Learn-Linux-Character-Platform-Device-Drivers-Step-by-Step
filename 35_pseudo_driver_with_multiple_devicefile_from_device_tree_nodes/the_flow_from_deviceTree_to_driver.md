Perfect 👍 now that we’ve upgraded the driver so that **each device tree node gets its own `/dev/pseudoX` device file**, the flow of interaction changes a little compared to the earlier “just platform_device + driver” case.

Here’s a clear **step-by-step diagram** of the flow:

---

## 📑 Flow Diagram: DT node → Platform driver → Char device `/dev/pseudoX`

```plaintext
+------------------------+
| Device Tree (DTS)      |
|                        |
| pseudo@0 {             |
|   compatible = "myvendor,pseudo"; |
|   label = "Device0";   |
|   some-value = <10>;   |
| };                     |
| pseudo@1 { ... };      |
| pseudo@2 { ... };      |
+------------------------+
            |
            v
+------------------------+
| Kernel Boot / OF Core  |
| - Parses DT            |
| - Creates platform_device
|   for each node         |
+------------------------+
            |
            v
+-------------------------------+
| platform_driver (pseudo_drv)  |
| - Has .of_match_table         |
| - Matches "myvendor,pseudo"   |
| - .probe() runs per device    |
+-------------------------------+
            |
            v
+------------------------------------------------+
| Driver probe()                                 |
| 1. Read platform data from DT                  |
|    - of_property_read_string(node,"label",...) |
|    - of_property_read_u32(node,"some-value",...)|
| 2. Allocate driver private data (driver_data)  |
|    - struct pseudo_dev { pdata + miscdevice }  |
| 3. Register miscdevice → creates /dev/pseudoX  |
+------------------------------------------------+
            |
            v
+-----------------------------------+
| User space interaction             |
|                                    |
| - open("/dev/pseudo0") →           |
|     driver .open() called          |
| - read("/dev/pseudo1") →           |
|     driver .read() called          |
| - write("/dev/pseudo2") →          |
|     driver .write() called         |
|                                    |
| Each file maps back to its device’s|
| driver_data (pdata + runtime state)|
+-----------------------------------+
```

## 🔍 Key Matching Technique

* **Device Tree match**:
  Uses `of_match_table` in the driver. Example:

  ```c
  static const struct of_device_id pseudo_of_match[] = {
      { .compatible = "myvendor,pseudo" },
      {},
  };
  MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, pseudo_of_match);
  ```

  → When the kernel sees a DT node with `compatible = "myvendor,pseudo"`, it binds that node to this driver.

* **Probe per node**:
  Each DT node becomes one `platform_device`.
  For 3 nodes → driver’s `probe()` runs **3 times**, each time creating a separate `/dev/pseudoX`.

* **Device file creation**:
  Inside `probe()`, the driver calls `misc_register(&pdev->miscdev)` (or cdev_add if using cdev).
  That makes `/dev/pseudo0`, `/dev/pseudo1`, `/dev/pseudo2`.

* **Driver data flow**:
  `platform_set_drvdata(pdev, priv)` links the platform_device to driver’s private data.
  Later, inside `.open()`/`.read()`/`.write()`, you retrieve it using:

  ```c
  struct pseudo_dev *priv = container_of(file->private_data,
                                         struct pseudo_dev,
                                         miscdev);
  ```

---

✅ So now the picture is:

* **DT node** → `platform_device` (with platform_data from DT)
* **Driver probe()** → allocates driver_data + registers `/dev/pseudoX`
* **User space** → accesses `/dev/pseudoX` → which maps back to correct device instance.

Would you like me to **upgrade the driver code** we wrote earlier so it actually registers a `/dev/pseudoX` miscdevice for *each* DT node, with full comments like before?
