Perfect 🚀 now you’re entering **pinctrl + device tree (DT) muxing** territory, which is exactly how Raspberry Pi 4B (Broadcom BCM2711) switches a physical pin between **GPIO / I²C / SPI / UART** functions.

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

# 🔹 1. Raspberry Pi 4B GPIO Alt Functions

Each GPIO on the BCM2711 SoC can be **muxed** into different functions:

* GPIO2  → default is **SDA1** (I²C bus 1 data)
* GPIO3  → default is **SCL1** (I²C bus 1 clock)
* GPIOs 0–27 can take on multiple ALT modes (UART, SPI, I²C, etc.).

Normally, if you export GPIO2 and GPIO3, you can use them as **regular GPIO**.
But if you want **I²C**, you must configure them via **pinctrl in the device tree**.

---

# 🔹 2. Device Tree and Pin Controller

On Raspberry Pi 4, the pin controller is described in the base DT file
(`/boot/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb`). Overlays are applied to select functions.

Example node for **I²C1** in DT:

```dts
&i2c1 {
    status = "okay";
    pinctrl-names = "default";
    pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_pins>;
    clock-frequency = <100000>;   /* 100kHz */
};

&pinctrl {
    i2c1_pins: i2c1-pins {
        brcm,pins = <2 3>;       /* GPIO2 = SDA, GPIO3 = SCL */
        brcm,function = <4>;     /* ALT0 function = I2C1 */
        brcm,pull = <0>;         /* 0 = none, 1 = pull-down, 2 = pull-up */
    };
};
```

👉 Explanation:

* `&i2c1` → Refers to the I²C controller hardware block inside BCM2711.
* `pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_pins>` → Says: *use this pinmux setup*.
* `brcm,function = <4>` → ALT0 = I²C function for GPIO2/3.
* `status = "okay"` → Enables this hardware block.

---

# 🔹 3. Using Device Tree Overlay

Instead of modifying the base DTB, Raspberry Pi OS provides **overlays** in `/boot/overlays/`.

For I²C1, you can enable it in `/boot/config.txt`:

```ini
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
```

This internally loads something like `i2c1.dtbo`, which configures the pinmux and enables the controller.

If you wanted I²C on different pins (say GPIO44/45 for I²C0), you could write your own overlay:

```dts
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/;

/ {
    compatible = "brcm,bcm2711";

    fragment@0 {
        target = <&i2c1>;
        __overlay__ {
            status = "okay";
            pinctrl-names = "default";
            pinctrl-0 = <&i2c1_alt_pins>;
            clock-frequency = <400000>;
        };
    };

    fragment@1 {
        target = <&pinctrl>;
        __overlay__ {
            i2c1_alt_pins: i2c1_alt_pins {
                brcm,pins = <2 3>;
                brcm,function = <4>; /* ALT0 → I2C1 */
                brcm,pull = <2>;     /* pull-up */
            };
        };
    };
};
```

Save as `myi2c1-overlay.dts`, compile with `dtc -@ -I dts -O dtb -o myi2c1.dtbo myi2c1-overlay.dts`, then enable in `config.txt`:

```ini
dtoverlay=myi2c1
```

---

# 🔹 4. After Boot

* Kernel loads I²C driver (`i2c-bcm2835` or `i2c-bcm2708`)
* A new adapter appears:

  ```
  /dev/i2c-1
  ```
* You can talk to I²C devices with tools like `i2cdetect -y 1`.

---

# 🔹 5. Big Picture (Hierarchy)

```
/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-1/   ← struct device for bus
      │
      ├── new_device           ← sysfs to bind a device manually
      └── delete_device        ← sysfs to unbind

/dev/i2c-1   ← character device (major 89) for I²C transactions
```

* **/dev/i2c-1** → lets you do read/write/ioctl using `i2c-dev`.
* **/sys/class/i2c-adapter/** → sysfs representation (kobject hierarchy).
* **DT** → binds the GPIO pins to the I²C controller via `pinctrl`.

---

✅ So: if you want GPIOs to behave as **I²C pins**, you must configure them through **DT pinctrl**, not via `gpio_request()`. Once configured, the GPIO API won’t touch them because they’re owned by the I²C controller.

---

👉 Do you want me to **write a minimal overlay for Raspberry Pi 4 that creates a fake I²C device (like an EEPROM at address 0x50)** so you see how DT not only muxes pins but also instantiates devices on the bus?
